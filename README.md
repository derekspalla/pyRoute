# pyRoute
A cloud/mobile app route builder, rotator, and recorder for my wife's ice cream truck business.
I want it simple and permissive.

The application needs to do the following:
  1. Build and save route information.
  2. Rotate routes after they have been completed.
  3. Record information about time on route and money made on each leg of the route - i.e. how much money was made in each      subdivision/road.

It would be great if I could connect it to Waze for getting to each neighborhood/subdivision.
